# Wizzy Engine
Wizzy engine aims to be a cross-platform interactive application engine for creating any form of interactive applications from a 3D modelling application or a 2D graphics application to a game engine interface.

## Development
The development can be followed on my trello board: https://trello.com/b/Y1N2zPXm.html

## Building

Wizzy has gone over some changes lately so the old build guide is obsolete, a new one is coming soon.
