# Wizzy Engine
Wizzy engine aims to be a cross-platform interactive application engine for creating any form of interactive applications from a 3D modelling application or a 2D graphics application to a game engine interface.

## Development
The development can be followed on my trello board: https://trello.com/b/Y1N2zPXm.html

## Building
Clone the repo, update --init submodules & run premake (run generate_projects_win.bat if on windows). To generate projects on another run the premake executable found in "vendor/bin/premake/PLATFORM/premake5" and give it an argument for what project files you want to generate (vs2019, gmake2, codelite, xcode4).
