# Small tasks

  Should probably rename to 'Table'.
- Build FreeType 2 binaries for linux

# Medium tasks
- Job system for editor
- Debug ECS serialization (sometimes just... incorrect data)
- Figure out how interactive scripting will work

# Large tasks
## Editor
- Editor Project System GUI
- Editor Resource Management GUI
- Editor full ImGui customization
- Audio :(
## Rendering
- Refactor renderer2D to use manually allocated RAM for the buffer and upload to 
  VRAM (glBufferSubData) instead of mapping the buffer
- Font rendering
- Implement DirectX rendering
## Misc
- Create documentation on charlie-malmqvist.com/Wizzy/documentation.html
- Resource VFS
- Improve/Abstract (& refactor) serialization system
- Write a good readme
- Create a tutorial video on how to create a project linking wizzy
	- Show how to link by making a premake script and dynamically build wizzy
	- Show how to build binaries and link (without premake script)

# Wishful thinking tasks
- Implement Vulkan rendering
