For editor, make systems and put their gui in an noter system (i.e. MySystem & MySystemGui). 
This way these systems can be reused when making a game-running project to run a game 
without the editor.

The resource manifest should be the resource directory built into a resources.manifest file 
which will be used for a published game project. SetResourceDir() should accept .manifest
files and parse them to create a virtual directory for the resources so ResourceManagement
can be used the same way in the editor game and the published game.
